# Ember for Jellyfin — LG webOS

Ember is a standalone Jellyfin player for webOS TV, originally inspired by Wholphin for Android TV. This is an early implementation, not feature parity with Android Wholphin. No Android build or Jellyfin Web deployment is required. The UI follows the home and movie-detail screenshots in the root README and the Android Compose implementation.

Implemented: Wholphin-style focused-item backdrops and summaries, collapsible navigation drawer, poster rows, favorites browsing/toggle, cast details, server URL/password login, saved session and sign out, continuous library/folder browsing with sorting and filters, continue watching, next up, recently added, title search, item details, resume, playback controls, remote directional navigation, and Jellyfin playback progress/stopped reporting. Magic Remote pointer clicks use standard buttons and inputs.

## Subtitle controls

The in-player subtitle panel separates Tracks, Timing and Appearance. Track labels use language, format and accessibility flags; each shows whether the TV can render it locally or video burn-in is required. Timing offers immediate half-second earlier/later adjustments for local text cues without restarting playback. These adjustments are saved for the TV account and should be reset for videos that do not need them. Automatic alignment to dialogue can be handled by Bazarr audio synchronization when downloading subtitles; Ember does not analyze the movie audio itself.

## Subtitle downloads

Choose **Find subtitles…** in a movie or episode subtitle menu, or in the player’s Subtitles panel. Search by language and select **Download and use**. Ember shows SRT/WebVTT results, prioritizes exact file matches, waits for Jellyfin’s track refresh, then selects the new track. Jellyfin needs a configured subtitle provider, subtitle management permission for the signed-in user, and permission to write subtitle files. SRT/WebVTT text renders locally by default on webOS/Tizen, unless the user explicitly selects Server (original) in Subtitle appearance; PGS still uses server burn-in there. New Fire TV sidecars may reload the player at its current position to attach the track.

## Run locally

From this directory:

```sh
npm run serve
# Open http://localhost:8080
npm run check
npm test
```

The source has no runtime dependencies or build step. Target webOS 5+ initially; older versions are untested. The app uses modern browser APIs including fetch, AbortController, async functions, and CSS Grid. Native HLS playback is expected on the TV; desktop browsers without native HLS can browse but cannot play transcoded streams.

Use a full server URL, such as `http://192.168.1.20:8096` or `https://media.example.com/jellyfin`. A bare address without a port defaults to HTTP port `8096`. Explicit HTTP/HTTPS URLs retain their standard ports for reverse proxies. The server must be reachable from the TV and allow the app's origin through any reverse proxy. HTTPS certificates must be trusted by the TV. The app stores the Jellyfin access token locally, not your password. Sign out removes the saved token and attempts to revoke the server session.

## Package and sideload

Install the official LG CLI on your computer:

```sh
npm install -g @webos-tools/cli
npm run package
```

The resulting package is `dist/com.github.damontecres.wholphin.webos_0.2.41_all.ipk`.

1. Install LG's **Developer Mode** app from the TV's app store and sign in with an LG developer account.
2. Enable Developer Mode, reboot if requested, and enable Key Server. Note the TV IP address and passphrase.
3. On your computer, run the interactive device setup and add a TV named `myTV` (SSH port `9922`, user `prisoner`). Retrieve its key, entering the passphrase shown on the TV:

```sh
ares-setup-device
ares-novacom --device myTV --getkey
ares-install --device myTV dist/com.github.damontecres.wholphin.webos_0.2.41_all.ipk
ares-launch --device myTV com.github.damontecres.wholphin.webos
```

Keep the Developer Mode session extended. Expiration can disable Developer Mode and remove development apps. See [LG Developer Mode instructions](https://webostv.developer.lge.com/develop/getting-started/developer-mode-app) and [LG CLI guide](https://webostv.developer.lge.com/develop/tools/cli-dev-guide).

## Remote controls

- D-pad: move focus; OK: activate. Left from the first poster opens the navigation drawer, Right returns to the previous content focus, and Up/Down move between poster rows. In text fields, left/right move the caret when the field contains text; up/down move between fields.
- Back: stop playback, otherwise return to the previous screen. At the root on a TV, confirm exit.
- Playback buttons: play/pause, stop, rewind/fast-forward (30 seconds).
- On-screen controls also support play/pause, 30-second seek, and stop. Controls fade after three seconds of playback; OK reveals them and left/right seek when they are hidden.
- Fill screen crops the picture to fill the display; Fit video preserves its aspect ratio.
- Backgrounding the app pauses playback.

## Playback scope

The initial device profile advertises MP4 H.264/AAC/MP3 direct playback, with conservative 1080p/H.264 level 4.1 limits. Other media requests HLS H.264/AAC stereo transcoding from Jellyfin. The user needs server transcoding permissions and the server needs a working encoder. Subtitle formats advertised in the profile use server burn-in by default; v0.2.12 adds opt-in TV styling for SRT/WebVTT text, with authenticated extraction and subtitles disabled in the delivered video to avoid duplicates; audio/subtitle pickers are available during on-demand playback in v0.2.5, with a brief stream reload at the current position when changing tracks. Compatibility remains the default. Version 0.2.8 adds an opt-in experimental LG C1 native profile for HEVC/4K/HDR10 and Dolby audio, plus a separate experimental Dolby Vision MP4 toggle; see [native playback scope and validation](NATIVE-PLAYBACK.md). Audio passthrough is not verified or promised.

Resume reloads the latest server bookmark, then seeks the native player to that absolute time for both direct playback and HLS. Initial seeks are retried as the TV becomes ready; session reporting begins only after the seek is confirmed. Progress and stop reports are ordered, with no extra offset added to HLS timestamps. A failed initial seek preserves the bookmark. Seeking still depends on the TV's native HLS seekable window. Native mode has a single Compatibility retry on decoder failure.

Not implemented: multiple accounts, DVR recording management, music, Seerr on LG/Tizen, subtitle search/download, trickplay, refresh-rate switching, and Android/MPV-specific playback features.


## Home and loading

Home combines Continue watching and Next up by default (or shows separate rows when configured), followed by **Recently added in <library>** for each video library. Nonempty favorite movie/show, collection, and playlist rows follow. Live TV libraries get a landscape **Watch live** programme row. Music, photos, and books do not get Home rows in this video-focused port.

Use **Settings → Customize Home** to enable the Watch live row, combine Continue watching/Next up, show poster titles, enable recently released rows, enable favorites/collections/playlists, or hide selected library rows. Choices are saved per server and user on this device; Android Wholphin's full row editor and server-synced settings are not implemented yet.

Rows request data independently with two concurrent row jobs. Nearby rows load first, offscreen rows wait until approaching the viewport, and failures show a local Retry button. Returning to Home uses a short in-memory row cache; stopping playback invalidates the resume rows. Empty rows do not displace the current focused card while results arrive.

Poster URLs are assigned only when images intersect the visible scrolling area or approach keyboard focus, using IntersectionObserver rather than relying on newer browser-native lazy loading. The focused card and its immediate neighbors are prefetched. Backdrops wait for focus to settle. Sidebar labels and nodes remain stable across Home refreshes; cached library names are available immediately after app restart.

## Reference screenshots and live TV

The supplied screenshots guide title-logo placement, episode subtitle/air-date details, expected finish times, episode poster badges, and the profile initial. Logos come from Jellyfin image assets, with a text fallback when no logo exists. Combined Continue watching preserves multiple in-progress episodes of the same show and suppresses redundant Next up entries.

Watch live uses currently airing Jellyfin EPG programmes and a channel's negotiated HLS stream. The app disables live seeking, carries the live stream identifier in session reports, and explicitly releases the tuner on stop, failed preparation, or backgrounding. Live TV is experimental: negotiation and cleanup have local mock-server coverage, but real tuner playback has **not** been validated on the C1. No TV app was opened or navigated during this update.

## Verification

`npm test` covers URL validation, reverse-proxy paths, stream selection, credential encoding, conservative codec profiles, and directional focus selection.

Optional Playwright tests exercise login, browsing, details, D-pad focus, resume, playback reporting, Back focus restoration, search, saved login, drawer focus restoration, row navigation, favorites requests, and sign out against mocked Jellyfin responses. A separate Home test checks slow and failed rows, per-library requests, lazy poster network requests, sidebar identity/labels, and saved Home options. The media engine is stubbed: passing it does not verify decoding or native HLS.

```sh
npm install --no-save playwright
npx playwright install chromium
npm run test:browser
```

Before considering this ready for daily use, test on a physical LG TV with a real Jellyfin server: password login and restart, large libraries, MP4 direct play, MKV transcode, burned subtitles, resume and seek, finished episodes, server disconnects, and Developer Mode reinstall. Record the TV model/webOS version and Jellyfin version with failures. Initial device validation now covers LG OLED77C1PUB (webOS SDK 6.5.3, firmware 03.53.45): installation, signed-in browsing, full-viewport player geometry, and native HLS resume against a real Jellyfin server. A saved position of 665.277 seconds resumed at 665.277 seconds and remained 665.277 seconds after stopping. This does not cover every codec, subtitle format, or long playback session.

Holiday rows (v0.2.3) follow the native query presets in [KefinTweaks](https://github.com/ranaldsgift/KefinTweaks/blob/main/scripts/homeScreenConfig2.js): January New Year's, February Valentine's, October Halloween (including Horror and Thriller movies), November Thanksgiving, and December Christmas. They appear after Continue watching/Next up for the entire corresponding month, using the TV's local date each time Home loads. Movie rows require matching Jellyfin tags (`new year's eve`, `valentine's day`, `halloween`, `thanksgiving`, `christmas`); episode rows search episode names. Horror/Thriller rows use genres. Empty rows hide automatically; posters retain lazy loading. Disable these rows in Settings → Customize Home. No server plugin is required, and server metadata is never changed. This ports the query presets, not arbitrary server-side KefinTweaks custom sections or its animated themes.

Version 0.2.4 adds **Use Quick Connect** below password sign-in. Enter the server URL, select it, then approve the displayed six-digit code from Settings → Quick Connect in a signed-in Jellyfin phone/browser. Jellyfin must have Quick Connect enabled. Cancel/Back stops polling; a new code can be generated after expiry or an error. Hiding the app cancels pending approval. Password sign-in remains available.

Loading now overlaps cold library discovery with Continue watching/Next up, cancels old Home requests on navigation, bounds the row cache, and requests smaller portrait images. The API uses a canonical server URL with redirects disabled. See [security review and remaining limits](SECURITY-REVIEW.md), including HTTP transport and saved access-token storage. Version 0.2.4 is locally tested and packaged; device validation is pending.


## Playback controls in v0.2.5

- **Audio / Subtitles:** open a remote-navigable list of tracks from the selected Jellyfin media source. Audio and subtitle indices are preserved independently; **Off** explicitly disables subtitles. A change negotiates an HLS stream at the current position, stops/reports and cleans up the previous stream, and preserves paused state and Fit/Fill. Failed negotiation keeps the old stream available. Explicit choices use server transcoding; subtitle formats advertised by the client use burn-in. Server transcoding permission and a working encoder are required. These selectors currently cover on-demand videos; live TV selectors remain disabled. From v0.2.6, successful language choices and subtitle Off are remembered per server/account on this TV and applied to subsequent videos (details below).
- **Chapters:** jump to Jellyfin chapter markers using their names and times. The button becomes available when valid markers are loaded. No synthetic chapters or chapter thumbnails are generated.
- **Queue:** add videos from their detail pages, view the queue from Settings/detail pages or the player, and play, remove, reorder, or clear entries. The manual queue holds up to 100 videos and stays in memory until app restart or sign-out. Explicit queued videos take priority over automatically following episodes. **Next** advances manually; natural completion also advances queued videos.
- **Autoplay next episodes:** enabled by default, switchable in Settings or Queue, and saved per account on this TV. The client requests the current episode and its successors from Jellyfin in series order, including across season boundaries. It shows up to 20 following episodes and refreshes that window as playback advances. Missing/virtual and unrelated episodes are excluded; a missing current-episode anchor prevents automatic guessing. Disabling autoplay stops automatic episode progression while retaining the explicit manual queue. Series finales stop normally. No countdown or pass-out protection is implemented in this first version.
- **Back** closes a playback menu first; another Back stops playback. D-pad focus stays in an open menu. Leaving the app does not initiate episode autoplay. Cancelling playback also aborts an in-progress stream negotiation, so its late response cannot restart the player.

The new controls have mocked-browser coverage for stream indices, subtitle Off, position/pause preservation, failed switching, chapters, menu navigation, queue ordering/priority, report ordering, autoplay On/Off, season boundaries, final episodes and cancellation races. Local screenshots were inspected at 1920×1080. Actual C1 decoding, subtitle burn-in and autoplay still need device validation; v0.2.5 is staged only.


## Remembered audio and subtitles in v0.2.6

Selecting a track saves its language and role after playback successfully starts at the intended position. Later on-demand videos, including autoplay and queued videos, map those preferences to their own stream indices. Common two-/three-letter language codes and regional forms are normalized (for example `es`, `spa`, and `es-MX`). Forced subtitles stay distinct from full subtitles; commentary and described audio stay distinct from normal audio. Hearing-impaired variants are preferred when the selected variant is available.

An unavailable audio match uses Jellyfin's default audio. An unavailable subtitle match disables subtitles for that video. Neither fallback overwrites the saved preference, so the desired language returns when available again. Explicit subtitle **Off** persists even if another episode defaults to subtitles On. Tracks without usable language metadata apply only to the current video and clear the remembered preference for that track type rather than guessing. Failed or cancelled switches do not replace saved preferences.

Preferences are local to this TV and keyed by server/account; they survive restart and sign-out but do not change Jellyfin's server-side user settings. **Settings → Reset track preferences** restores server defaults for subsequent videos without changing autoplay settings or interrupting the current video. Live TV retains its previous behavior.

When preferences need mapping, the client uses media-source metadata already on the item if available, otherwise a read-only PlaybackInfo request before its single playback negotiation. It does not start a temporary playback session to discover indices. Explicit indices now always identify a media source, using a metadata request when needed. A remembered Off matching the source default does not force a new HLS stream; other explicit mapped choices can use native video-copy HLS when eligible, or Compatibility when burn-in is required. v0.2.6 remains locally tested and staged; actual C1 validation is pending.


## Continuous library browsing in v0.2.7

Libraries and folders are a single scrolling grid. More items are fetched as the viewport approaches the loaded end, or when D-pad navigation needs another row. There are no Next/Previous page controls. Only one item request runs per view; failures retain already loaded items and offer Retry. The client handles missing total counts and short server batches, deduplicates item IDs, and stops automatic requests if a server returns only repeated items.

**Sort** offers title, release date and date added, each in both directions. **Show** filters watched/unwatched; **Genre** and **Year** use Jellyfin's library-scoped filter metadata, loaded only when needed. Filters combine, **Reset filters** clears them while preserving the sort, and **Refresh library** fetches current server data. Root movie and TV libraries use their video/series item types; nested folders retain their direct-child hierarchy. Preferences are saved per library, server and account on this TV.

Loaded metadata and focus/scroll position are retained in memory for the three most recently visited library/folder views. Returning from a details page reuses that state without starting from the beginning. Restarting the app retains sort/filter choices but starts browsing at the top. Use Refresh to see changes made on the server during a cached browsing session.

Only a small window of cards around the visible rows is rendered, with spacers preserving scroll geometry; previously loaded item metadata remains available for scrolling back. Posters remain lazy-loaded and off-screen card image observers are released. Layout adapts to the existing six-/four-column breakpoints. This keeps the number of rendered cards bounded as more items load. Backend requests use offsets internally; the UI remains continuous scrolling.

Validation includes 22 core tests and eight local browser suites. The focused library fixture checks loading beyond 48 items, virtual card removal, lazy posters, retry and duplicate-batch recovery, concurrent scroll/D-pad requests, focus across a delayed load, exact Back restoration, combined filters, stale-query cancellation, absent totals, capped server batches and saved preferences. Mock screenshots were inspected at 1920×1080. Real LG C1 performance still needs validation; v0.2.7 is staged only.


## Playback information and native mode in v0.2.8

Select **Playback info** during playback for source codecs/container/resolution/HDR metadata, server-reported delivered codecs and resolution, bitrate, copy-versus-encode status, transcode reasons, decoded size and available frame counters. Use the D-pad to read individual rows and **Refresh playback info** to take another server snapshot. The panel displays no media URLs, tokens or filesystem paths. If the account cannot read session information, source metadata remains available and delivered-stream details are marked unavailable. The client does not claim that source HDR metadata proves active HDR output or that copied audio proves passthrough.

In Settings, **Playback mode: Compatibility** can be switched to **LG C1 native (experimental)**. **Dolby Vision MP4 (experimental)** is a separate toggle, initially Off. These choices are saved per server/account. Existing installations remain in Compatibility until changed. Native playback errors make one Compatibility retry at the last known position; the info panel also offers **Use Compatibility for this video**, preserving position and pause state. Neither fallback changes the global mode or repeats indefinitely. Burned-in subtitles use the H.264/AAC path; turning them Off can restore native video-copy eligibility. Live TV continues to use its previous compatibility path.

See [native format limits, references, and the pending device test matrix](NATIVE-PLAYBACK.md). All 25 core tests and nine local browser suites pass. Native media in the new fixture is simulated, and no new LG hardware decoding/display/audio validation has been performed. v0.2.8 is staged only.

### v0.2.9 — Up Next and unattended playback

Up Next previews the next queued video or episode, including available artwork and description. The countdown follows the current video's remaining playback time; playback advances at its actual end. Play now advances immediately; Cancel or Back suppresses automatic advance for that video, including queued videos. Seeking away from the end hides the preview. Live TV does not show Up Next.

Account-scoped Settings offer countdown Off/15/30/60 seconds (default 30), and Still watching Off/every 3/every 5 episodes (default 3). The latter waits at an episode boundary for Keep watching or Stop watching, with no unattended playback while unanswered. Explicit confirmation resets the episode count; track changes and Compatibility retries preserve it. Manual standalone playback starts a new count. Artwork/description depend on server metadata. Local mocked browser coverage verifies countdown timing, pause, seeking, cancellation and confirmation; physical TV validation is pending.

### v0.2.10 — LG packaged startup fix

Explicitly permits local `file:` scripts, styles and images in the document security policy. The C1's Chromium 79 rejected `'self'` for these installed resources, leaving v0.2.9 blank before login. Remote and inline scripts remain blocked. Adds a startup smoke test for both source and extracted IPK contents.

### v0.2.11 — Season selection and media controls

Series details now offer Choose season, including Specials in numeric season order. Episode details offer View seasons. A season switcher remains above the continuous episode grid, with episode-number sorting by default and the selected season restored on Back. Season loading failures offer Retry.

Playback now has icon-based play/pause, 30-second skip, Next and Stop controls, a focusable/clickable seek bar, elapsed/total time and time remaining. Audio, subtitles, chapters, queue, screen fit and diagnostics sit under Options. Left/Right on the seek bar moves ten seconds; Enter returns to play/pause. Hidden controls can be revealed with Enter or directional keys; Left/Right while hidden also seeks ten seconds. Controls fade during playback, remain visible while paused or using Options, and Back first closes Options or a playback panel, then hides controls before leaving playback on another Back. Live TV retains its disabled seek controls. Local browser tests cover seek input, remote navigation, Options focus, season retries/switching and Back restoration; validation on the physical TV is pending.


### v0.2.12 — Subtitle appearance and timing

Open **Settings → Subtitle appearance**, or **Options → Subtitles → Subtitle appearance** during playback. Choose text size, white/yellow/cyan, no/translucent/solid black background, bottom/raised/top placement, and −10 to +10 seconds of delay (positive means later). A preview updates before Apply. Changing an appearance option selects Styled on TV; choose Server (original) to restore burn-in. Reset returns to original server rendering and default appearance. Preferences are saved per server/account on this TV. No Jellyfin user settings or subtitle files are modified.

TV styling supports SRT/SubRip and WebVTT, including server extraction of embedded text. ASS/SSA, PGS and DVD/image tracks retain original server rendering; appearance and delay controls do not affect those burned-in subtitles. Live TV continues using server rendering. TV text intentionally uses plain text and the chosen appearance rather than source cue markup/positioning. If extraction fails, times out, is oversized or returns no usable cues, playback falls back to server burn-in with a notice.

Text is fetched from Jellyfin's authenticated [subtitle endpoint](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/blob/master/Jellyfin.Api/Controllers/SubtitleController.cs), with full absolute timestamps and no HLS time-map offset. Fetch/parse occurs before replacing the current stream. Video negotiation explicitly disables its subtitle track while the app displays cues, keeping the selected logical track for the picker, preferences and reports. Switching rendering mode preserves the playback position and pause state; appearance changes on an already-styled track apply without reloading video. Cancelling playback aborts pending extraction. Local tests cover timing/seek/overlap, plain-text safety, bounded parsing, mode/track switching, Off, bitmap/ASS preservation, paused resume, failure fallback and late-response cancellation. Physical TV subtitle-overlay validation is pending.

### v0.2.13 — Live TV channel guide

The sidebar now has a dedicated **Live TV** screen. Channel rows show numbers/logos, the programme on at the selected time, its progress when viewing Now, and the next programme. Select a channel to watch immediately, including channels with no EPG. Select a programme for details; future/finished programmes offer **Watch channel now**, which tunes the current broadcast rather than scheduling the selected show. This does not add DVR scheduling or catch-up playback.

**Later/Earlier** move the reference time in two-hour steps, up to 24 hours ahead. **Now** returns to current listings. The displayed timestamp identifies the reference time; use Now or Refresh guide to update it. Favorites stars update Jellyfin channel favorites, with an All/Favorites filter. D-pad moves between channel rows and listing columns; Back returns from details to the guide. Direct channel playback returns to the guide on Stop and releases its tuner.

Channels load continuously in batches of 24, with a bounded window of rendered rows. EPG requests are limited to nearby rows and two concurrent requests, with a small memory cache. A failing programme row offers Retry without blocking channel playback or other listings. Channel errors/permission failures offer Retry channels. Navigation cancels pending guide requests and stale responses cannot replace the next page. Uses Jellyfin's [Live TV channel/programme APIs](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/blob/master/Jellyfin.Api/Controllers/LiveTvController.cs). Local tests cover now/next selection, favorites, continuous loading, remote navigation, Back focus, lazy/bounded rendering, retries, denied access, no-EPG playback and tuner cleanup. Validated on the LG C1 (webOS 6.5 / Chromium 79) on 2026-10-31: all 79 configured channels loaded continuously; channel logos, now/next, later programme details, D-pad row navigation and Back worked. The Favorites filter correctly showed an empty state and was restored to All without changing saved favorites. A live 1920×1080 stream decoded without a reported media error, paused and resumed with advancing playback time, and returned to the guide on Stop. Jellyfin returned HTTP 204 for the stopped-session report, encoder cleanup and tuner close. No playback was left running. Other TV models and DVR functionality remain unvalidated.

### v0.2.14 — Subtitle selection before playback

Movie and episode details include a subtitle dropdown with available tracks, Off, and the default/remembered choice. Explicit choices apply to Play and Resume. Playback transport controls use ordered left/right remote navigation so Options stays reachable. Back exits playback and saves progress; the on-screen Stop button has been removed. Scrollbars are hidden throughout the TV interface while scrolling remains enabled.

### v0.2.15 — Progressive cast browsing

Details show the complete actor list in batches of eight instead of stopping at six. Portraits load near the viewport. Down from the actions enters the cast row, Left/Right follows cast order and keeps focus visible, and Up returns to the previous action. Horizontal pointer scrolling and the mouse wheel load more cast near the end. Missing portraits show an initial.

### v0.2.16 — Details focus and favorites

Returning from cast to the action row restores the details header instead of leaving the title clipped. Down from the actions focuses the subtitle selector, then Down enters cast; press OK on the selector to open available subtitle choices. Favorites use an accessible white outline heart, filled red when saved. The button updates after the server confirms the change and prevents duplicate requests.

### v0.2.17 — Reliable subtitle dropdown

The pre-play subtitle selector uses an app-controlled list instead of a native TV popup. It displays the actual selected track or Off. Explicit choices persist per account and video on the TV, while language preferences apply to other videos. Up/Down moves through an open list, OK selects, and Back cancels without changing the choice. Track choices reset with the existing Settings reset action.

### v0.2.18 — Stable sidebar labels

Sidebar labels keep a fixed layout and remain painted, with the collapsed header clipping the text. Expansion no longer toggles label visibility or reflows button widths. Focus inside the sidebar also expands it through CSS. D-pad focus scrolls the sidebar vertically while keeping horizontal offsets at zero.

### v0.2.19 — C1 sidebar repaint correction

Sidebar labels use explicit positioning within each row instead of flex text layout. The navigation has its own composited paint layer. This addresses rows reporting visible text while leaving it unpainted until focus moves over them. The change was checked against actual C1 screenshots through repeated drawer openings.

### v0.2.20 — Live TV guide preview

Back from full-screen Live TV returns to the guide with the current stream continuing in a small preview. Guide focus returns to the playing channel. Browsing keeps that channel playing; choosing another channel switches the preview and releases the previous tuner. Selecting the playing channel or Return to fullscreen expands the same stream without restarting it. Stop Live TV or Back from preview ends playback. Leaving the guide or hiding the app also ends the Live TV session.

### v0.2.21 — Programme details beside Live TV preview

The preview guide shows the highlighted programme title, channel, broadcast time, and description beside the video. Moving between channels or Now/Next updates these details from the bounded guide cache without changing playback or issuing extra detail requests. Missing listings and failed EPG loads show explicit placeholders.

Channel numbers and logos are informational labels rather than remote focus targets. OK on a currently airing programme watches that channel. Channels without EPG data keep a Watch live programme cell, and future programmes still open details.

### v0.2.22 — Collections and similar titles below Cast

Movie/show details include a named poster row for each collection the title belongs to, then More like this using Jellyfin recommendations. Episodes use their series for collection membership and similar titles. Collection contents load near the viewport and fetch additional pages as the row scrolls. Posters stay lazy, empty rows disappear, and each failed row has an independent retry. D-pad Down moves from Cast into the rows; Up returns to Cast. Opening a title and pressing Back restores its card, including within later collection pages.

### v0.2.23 — Channel label layout and fullscreen switching

Channel labels stack a centred logo above the channel number/name, allowing up to two text lines within the existing guide row height. Selecting a different channel from preview starts it fullscreen. Back returns the new channel to guide preview, and selecting the already-playing channel still expands its existing stream without restarting.

### v0.2.24 — Show overview and Start/Continue

Multi-season shows open a season poster grid, one card per available season. The first content row shows an in-progress episode, otherwise the next episode for watched shows, or Start watching at S1E1 for an unwatched show. Specials are not chosen ahead of season 1. A show with exactly one season opens that season’s episodes directly and keeps the Start/Continue row. Episode lists use All seasons to return to the overview rather than a strip of season buttons.

### v0.2.25 — Collection links on details

Below Cast, one Collections row shows a card for each collection containing the movie or show. Selecting a card opens the collection library; its contents are fetched there. More like this follows the Collections row. Back restores the selected collection card.

### v0.2.26 — Episode stills in seasons

Season episode grids use landscape episode stills with the same proportions as Start watching. Four cards fit each row, and virtual scrolling uses their shorter height. Episodes without a still show a placeholder instead of a series poster.

### v0.2.27 — Start/Continue episode description

The Start watching and Continue watching episode cards show the episode synopsis to their right, when available. The synopsis is plain text and the episode card keeps its existing remote navigation.

### v0.2.28 — Programme-first guide focus

Opening Live TV focuses the current programme. Left reaches the favorite star and Right returns to the programme. Entering the guide from its toolbar or sidebar also targets the current programme. Returning from programme details preserves the selected cell.

### v0.2.29 — Description follows episode focus

The episode synopsis beside Start/Continue updates while browsing season episode cards and returns to the Start/Continue synopsis when that card is focused. Missing summaries show an explicit fallback instead of the previous episode description.

### v0.2.30 — Collection scrolling

The Collections row keeps focused cards fully visible, supports vertical remote-wheel scrolling horizontally, and shows the focused collection position and total.

### v0.2.31 — TV library tabs

TV libraries open Recommended with a focus-driven preview and library-scoped Continue watching, Next Up, Recently Released, Recently Added, Top Rated Unwatched, and Suggestions rows. Suggestions currently shuffle unwatched series rather than using Android Wholphin’s cached recommendation service. Library preserves continuous scrolling and filters. Genres and Studios open filtered series grids. Collections checks membership with at most two concurrent requests, hides movie-only collections, and opens TV-series-only contents for mixed collections. Category results load in batches as the page scrolls. Use Left/Right across tabs, Enter to select, Down to enter content, and Up from the first recommendation row to return to tabs.

### v0.2.32 — Series and season browsing

Multi-season shows display one horizontal Seasons row with season names, years and unwatched counts when supplied. Start/Continue remains above it, and the series Play/Resume action uses that episode. Opening a season shows season tabs, a focus-driven episode title/metadata/description, a scrolling rail of episode stills, and Play/Resume, watched state, favorite and More options controls below. More options opens episode details including subtitle selection. Cast & Crew and Guest stars follow when the server provides them. Single-season shows open directly into this episode view. Season episodes load in batches of 48 with lazy stills, retry, request cancellation, and cached Back restoration.

### v0.2.33 — Episode subtitle selector

TV season browsing uses the same pre-play subtitle dropdown as movie details, including Off, remembered choices, retry, and D-pad navigation. Selection updates for the focused episode and is applied by Play/Resume. Episode metadata lists video/audio only instead of subtitle tracks.

### v0.2.34 — Concise episode format summary

Episode previews show resolution, video codec and the default audio channel format (for example 720p · HEVC · Stereo). Raw track titles, release-group labels and duplicate audio tracks are excluded.

### v0.2.35 — Movie tabs, format pills and expanding actions

Movie libraries open Recommended, Library, Collections and Genres tabs. Recommended rows are Continue watching, Recently Added, Recently Released, Top Rated Unwatched, the current month's populated holiday movie rows, then Suggestions (unwatched movies in random order). Movie collections exclude show-only collections and open mixed collections with only films. Movie and episode detail format summaries use separate resolution/codec/audio pills. Detail actions use official Material icons, expand labels on focus, and respect reduced-motion settings. Pointer activation waits until click before changing focus to prevent expanding controls from moving away under the cursor. Movies also expose Mark as watched/unwatched beside their other actions. Material icon sources and Apache-2.0 license are bundled in app/icons/.

The main movie action row follows the reference order: Play/Resume, restart when resumable, watched state, favorite, playback queue (filmstrip), and More. Add to queue and Back are available inside More. Resolution pills use standard tiers for cropped files and append structured HDR/Dolby Vision metadata; raw stream titles are never displayed.

### v0.2.36 — New icon, TV holidays and smoother actions

TV Recommended includes the current month’s holiday episode rows before Suggestions, hidden when empty. Action labels expand to their measured text width over 240ms with a gentle ease-out and a short delayed fade, rather than animating toward a fixed oversized width. Reduced-motion behavior is preserved. The launcher icon is replaced with a generated dolphin/play mark.

### v0.2.37 — Bottom row spacing

Movie/TV libraries, category grids and details have extra bottom padding with a lower focus inset. Recommended rows have a larger trailing spacer so final posters and labels can scroll clear of the screen edge.

### v0.2.38 — Bonfire profiles

Optional Bonfire support adds Switch profile in Settings and, when detected, the sidebar. The picker shows avatars and requests a PIN when required by the server. Switching uses the server-issued profile session, clears content caches and keeps preferences scoped to the selected account. The original account credential is retained for profile management; full sign-out revokes both sessions. PINs are never saved. Profile creation and administration remain in Bonfire. Settings can retry discovery after the plugin is installed.

### v0.2.39 — Startup profiles and seasonal picker

Bonfire profiles appear at startup and after Jellyfin sign-in. Profile list/switch requests use the current scoped session: Bonfire resolves its household server-side. Legacy saved original credentials are discarded, fixing switching after the original token expires. PIN requirements remain enforced by Bonfire.

The TV profile picker automatically uses Bonfire-inspired Harvest colors October 17–November 2 and from two weeks before US Thanksgiving through two days afterward; Snowfall December 11–January 2; Bloom two weeks before Gregorian Easter through two days afterward. Outside those windows the normal picker returns. This appearance is local to the TV app and does not overwrite server profile themes.

### v0.2.40 — Single profile control and Bonfire avatars

The duplicate initial above the sidebar is hidden when Bonfire supplies the profile switcher. The remaining Switch profile control displays the current Bonfire profile picture, or its configured initial/color when there is no usable image. Profile cards share the same image validation and fallback behavior. Transparent avatars retain their transparent background.

### v0.2.41 — Ember

The app is now Ember for Jellyfin, with a new flame/play launcher icon and Ember branding in the launcher, sidebar, Settings and Jellyfin sessions. The existing webOS application ID, device identifier and local storage keys are preserved so this installs as an update and retains sign-in, settings and preferences.

### v0.2.42 — Profile picker without sidebar

The sidebar stays hidden while startup profiles load and throughout profile/PIN selection. It returns after successful selection. Remote focus remains within visible picker controls; Back cancels a pending startup switch and returns to the picker.

### v0.2.43 — One Continue watching entry per show

Continue watching groups in-progress episodes by series, retaining the episode with the newest LastPlayedDate (or the first server result when timestamps are absent). Next Up does not add another entry for that series. This applies to Home and TV Recommended and leaves all server resume points intact.

### v0.2.44 — Fullscreen profile gate

Profile selection fills the entire viewport with centered profile cards, without sidebar spacing, clock or background artwork. PIN entry stays within the same fullscreen view. There is no Back button into content; remote Back returns to profile selection. Home appears after a profile is selected successfully.

### v0.2.45 — Refresh launcher icon paths

Ember launcher artwork uses new Ember-specific filenames to avoid reusing cached Wholphin icon paths. The installed image bytes were already correct; this updates the image references without uninstalling the app.

### v0.2.46 — Settings for TV

Settings uses a fixed category column and a separately scrolling list of full-width rows. Profile & Home, Playback, Subtitles, Device and About organize existing controls. Rows separate their title, explanation and current value, with a warm Ember focus treatment. D-pad Up/Down moves within a column; Right opens a category's controls; Left returns to the category, then the main sidebar. Categories align their heading at the top of the content pane. Current values update immediately and preserve the existing account-scoped preferences. No unsupported Android-only settings are shown.

### v0.2.47 — Community and critic ratings

Home/library previews, movie/show details and season episode previews display the server's community rating with a gold star and critic percentage with a red tomato and green leaf. Missing, nonnumeric and out-of-range scores are omitted; valid zero scores are retained. Rating symbols are rendered locally with accessible labels and no remote icon dependencies.

### v0.2.48 — Longer holiday seasons

Holiday rows retain eleven days after Halloween, Christmas and Valentine's Day. Halloween runs October 1–November 11; Thanksgiving runs November 12 through US Thanksgiving; Christmas takes over the following day through January 5; Valentine's runs February 1–25. No New Year's rows are shown. Christmas explicitly takes precedence over Thanksgiving's tail. Row keys remain anchored to the holiday's year/month across calendar boundaries. Profile colors follow the same season, with Harvest starting October 17 and Bloom lasting eleven days after Easter. Dates use the TV's local calendar.

### v0.2.49 — Alphabet rail

Library grids have a fixed right-side #/A–Z rail. Selecting a letter starts a title-ascending list at that server-side alphabetical boundary and continues loading subsequent titles as you scroll; # restores the full list from its beginning. Watch status, genre, year and category filters remain applied. Letter anchors stay in the in-memory Back cache, while filter/sort/reset changes clear the anchor. Right from the last poster in a row enters the rail, Up/Down selects a letter, OK jumps, and Left returns to the grid. The collapsed sidebar is 80px wide; expanded labels retain their existing width and paint behavior.

### v0.2.50 — Live controls and buffered seeking

Next video is hidden during Live TV. Live streams expose the seek bar and rewind/forward controls only when the TV reports a usable seekable range. Seeks clamp inside that sliding range with a one-second live-edge margin; the clock shows the delay behind live. Controls hide/disable again when the range disappears. This uses the stream buffer supplied through Jellyfin and the TV, not a DVR archive or a promise of seeking before tuning in. On-demand seeking retains its existing duration-based behavior.

Hardware check: the LG C1 playing WDTN HD through Jellyfin exposed a seekable live range. A ten-second rewind via the live timeline changed position and playback continued without a media error; the clock showed the live delay. This verifies that channel/session, not every tuner or live stream.

### v0.2.51 — Home customization

Settings → Customize Home now includes per-row Up/Down ordering, hide/show, poster/thumbnail artwork and removable pinned collection, playlist, genre and studio rows. Pinning shows a row of that source's titles, with account-scoped Jellyfin requests. Choices load in batches with search, retry and duplicate prevention. Existing row/library toggles and title labels remain available. Save/Cancel stay visible while scrolling; edits are a draft until saved, and cancel leaves saved preferences intact. Reset row order and artwork clears individual visibility/order/layout overrides without deleting pinned sources. Seasonal row settings use stable holiday keys across years. Empty rows remain hidden and Home retains lazy, bounded-concurrency loading. All preferences stay local to the selected profile on this TV.

### Seerr on Fire TV

The Fire TV build supports direct Seerr sign-in with Jellyfin or Seerr-local credentials from the **Seerr** sidebar entry or **Settings → Playback → Seerr**. No extra server container or API key is needed. Enter the Seerr base URL and sign in separately for each Ember profile.

Discover provides trending titles, movies, TV, upcoming movies, search and My requests, with additional results loaded as you browse. Movie and season requests require confirmation and respect Seerr permissions/quotas; 4K is offered when allowed. Available titles can open their Jellyfin detail page when Seerr supplies a Jellyfin item ID.

Native HTTP handles cookies and CSRF. Cookies are stored in Android app-private storage, scoped to the Ember profile, Jellyfin server and Seerr URL; passwords are not saved. Cookie expiry is respected and disconnect clears the current profile’s saved session. LG and Samsung do not show this Fire TV-only integration.
