# Ember for Jellyfin — webOS, Tizen and Fire TV

Ember is an unofficial, experimental Jellyfin client for LG webOS, Samsung Tizen and Android-based Fire TV devices, inspired by [Wholphin for Android TV](https://github.com/damontecres/Wholphin). This repository contains the standalone TV implementation; it does not require an Android build or a Jellyfin Web deployment.

Current version: **0.2.70**. Developed for an LG C1 running webOS 6.5; Samsung Q6FN / Tizen 4.0 installation and startup are also confirmed. Android-based Fire TV devices use Media3 1.11.1 with device-derived Direct Play profiles, native subtitle support and compatibility fallback. Direct Play has been validated on Fire TV hardware, including HDR10 on a supported display. Other models and media combinations remain under testing. This is not affiliated with or an official release of Wholphin, Jellyfin, LG, Samsung, or Amazon, and does not have feature parity with Android Wholphin.

The app was previously named Wholphin for webOS. Existing installations update in place and keep their sign-in and settings.

## Features

- Password and Quick Connect sign-in, customizable Home, library-specific rows and seasonal holiday rows.
- Continuous library browsing, season selection, sorting/filtering, search, favorites and item details.
- Resume playback, audio/subtitle selection, remembered track languages, styled SRT/WebVTT subtitles with previewed size/color/background/position choices, plus per-video/track timing in player configuration, chapters and playback queue.
- Search and download SRT/WebVTT subtitles through configured Jellyfin providers, before or during playback.
- Fire TV libass rendering for SSA/ASS, external text sidecars and in-place switching of supported loaded subtitles. LG/Tizen PGS continues to require server burn-in.
- Next-episode autoplay, Up Next previews/countdown and configurable Still watching confirmation.
- Live TV now/next guide, channel favorites, later listings, continuous channel browsing and playback without EPG.
- Conservative Compatibility playback by default; experimental opt-in LG C1 native HEVC/4K support and playback diagnostics.
- Remote navigation, standard media controls with a seek bar and Options menu, Magic Remote pointer controls and lazy-loaded posters.

## Development

```sh
cd webos
npm test
npm run check
npm run serve
```

Open http://localhost:8080 to browse locally. Desktop browsers without native HLS support cannot play the TV's transcoded HLS streams. The LG source runs directly. Separate platform builds and Samsung compatibility bundles are generated from the repository root. Browser tests additionally require Playwright and Chromium; see [webOS documentation](webos/README.md).

## Install

Install LG's Developer Mode app on the TV and the official `@webos-tools/cli` on your computer. Follow [package and sideload instructions](webos/README.md#package-and-sideload). Installing a package does not require launching it; launch only when you are ready to interrupt current viewing.

See [security notes](webos/SECURITY-REVIEW.md) and [native playback limitations and pending hardware tests](webos/NATIVE-PLAYBACK.md). Experimental native codec support is not a guarantee of HDR display output or audio passthrough.

## Separate platform builds

Shared UI source lives in `webos/app`; platform adapters are selected at build time.
Samsung uses AVPlay, Fire TV uses native AndroidX Media3, and both bundle browser compatibility helpers. LG retains its existing HTML video playback.

```sh
npm ci
npm test
npm run build:webos  # dist/webos, LG appinfo.json
npm run build:tizen  # dist/tizen, Samsung config.xml
npm run build:firetv # dist/firetv, bundled APK assets
npm run package:webos
TIZEN_PROFILE=YourSamsungProfile npm run package:tizen
npm run package:firetv # requires JDK 17 + Android SDK
```

Packaging requires the official LG CLI or Tizen CLI on PATH (or `ARES_PACKAGE` / `TIZEN_CLI`).
Samsung retail TV packages require your own Samsung TV author/distributor certificate profile,
including the target TV DUID. The SDK's default emulator certificate cannot be used for a retail TV.
Keep certificates and passwords outside this repository and back up the author certificate for future updates.
See [Samsung's certificate instructions](https://developer.samsung.com/smarttv/develop/getting-started/setting-up-sdk/creating-certificates.html).

Browser regression checks require Playwright (`PLAYWRIGHT_MODULE` and optional `CHROMIUM_PATH`).
After building Samsung, run `node test/tizen-browser.cjs` to exercise its adapter, remote keys,
compatibility polyfills, older IntersectionObserver API and navigation expansion.

Server addresses add port 8096 only for a 192.168.* host without an explicit port.
Other hosts retain the protocol's default port unless a port is entered.

Fire TV build, sideload, security and hardware validation details are in [platforms/firetv/README.md](platforms/firetv/README.md). This APK targets Android-based Fire OS devices, not Vega OS.

Wholphin branding/assets and the UI inspiration originate from [damontecres/Wholphin](https://github.com/damontecres/Wholphin); credit belongs to its contributors. Seasonal query presets are credited to [KefinTweaks](https://github.com/ranaldsgift/KefinTweaks), as documented in the source and webOS README. The Ember TV application is a separate implementation maintained here.

### Shared menu regression checks

After changing shared menus or remote navigation, run `npm run test:menus`.
This builds LG webOS, Samsung Tizen and Fire TV assets, then exercises the same
settings, nested subtitle appearance, Back/focus restoration and Home editor
flows against each platform bundle. Tizen and Fire TV also run with the legacy
layout fallback and missing APIs supplied by their compatibility bundle.
Set `PLAYWRIGHT_MODULE` and `CHROMIUM_PATH` if Playwright/Chromium are outside the
normal module and browser locations. These fixture checks complement device
validation; they do not verify native playback or actual TV firmware rendering.

### In-app screensaver

Settings → Device → Screensaver controls the profile's artwork slideshow.
It starts after five minutes of idle browsing by default, changes artwork every
30 seconds, and offers slow zoom, an optional moving clock, configurable timing,
and a preview. It uses movie/show backdrops accessible to the signed-in user.
Any remote press dismisses it and restores focus without activating the control
underneath. Playback (including paused video), profile selection, hidden apps and
suspension prevent or dismiss it. Empty/error artwork responses retain a moving
Ember title on black. This operates inside Ember; it does not replace or disable
the TV's system screensaver. Run `npm run test:screensaver` for the three-platform
fixture checks.

### Profile subtitle defaults

Settings → Subtitles → Subtitle defaults offers remembered choices, preferred
language when available, or Off. English captions for known non-English audio
are enabled by default and can be disabled separately. Defaults, remembered
choices and title overrides belong to the signed-in profile on this device;
selecting Off on one profile does not change another. An explicit title choice
wins over automatic defaults. Missing preferred subtitles stay off, and unknown
audio language does not trigger the non-English rule. Automatic selection favors
text subtitles over bitmap tracks when both are available.

LG/Tizen can extract ASS/SSA as plain WebVTT instead of burning it into video.
This loses ASS styling/positioning; bitmap captions and failed text extraction
retain the conversion fallback. Fire TV retains its native ASS renderer by
default. Run `npm run test:subtitle-defaults` for cross-platform coverage.

### Anime audio language

Settings → Playback → Anime audio language chooses Japanese, English or another
supported language for this profile on this TV. It defaults to the normal audio
preference. Anime is identified through a library with Anime in its name, item
ancestry, or an explicit Anime genre (Animation alone is not treated as anime).
The rule also runs when starting an episode through Continue watching or
autoplay; manual in-player audio selection takes priority for that playback.
Missing preferred audio falls back to the normal profile/server choice. Subtitle
defaults use the selected audio language, so Japanese audio can automatically
enable English captions. Run `npm run test:anime-audio` for platform checks.

### Profile language sync

Ember syncs subtitle defaults (mode, preferred language and English for non-English audio) and the anime audio language through Jellyfin’s per-user display preferences. Bonfire profiles use their own Jellyfin user IDs, so their choices remain separate. LG, Samsung and Fire TV use the same Ember settings namespace; no Bonfire update is required.

Settings refresh when a profile opens or Settings opens. Explicit changes save to the server immediately. A local cache keeps preferences usable offline, and pending changes retry the next time the profile or Settings opens. On first sync, existing device preferences migrate only when no server preference exists; otherwise the server choice wins. Individual-title track choices, subtitle timing and appearance remain local. Devices need Ember 0.2.77 or newer to participate.
